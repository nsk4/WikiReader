# WikiReader

Turn Wikipedia articles into spoken audio â€” right in your browser.

This is a quick prototype built using SvelteKit to test the concept of reading Wikipedia articles aloud using only free, offline, browser-native tools (Wikipedia API + `speechSynthesis`).

No accounts, no paid APIs, no installs.

## How it works
- Paste a Wikipedia article URL
- The app fetches the main article text via the Wikipedia public API
- The browser's built-in Text-to-Speech reads the article aloud

## ðŸš§ Note
This is a minimal MVP prototype developed during a personal creative break. Expect bugs and unpolished UX!
